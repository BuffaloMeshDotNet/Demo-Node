# Demo-Node
This is a pop up demo for services on the mesh. There's scripts for 3 various
flavors of Linux: Raspian, Debian, and CentOS.  The Debian and CentOS scripts
just make sure a LAMP stack is present along with the git clients (To clone
down the apps).  The Raspian script does a lot of clean up with unrequired 
packages, and this all fits on a 4GB card.

You should get a set of 3 apps, and you can keep re-running the scripts safely.
It doesn't harm anything to do so, and in fact will update the apps if there's
new versions.
